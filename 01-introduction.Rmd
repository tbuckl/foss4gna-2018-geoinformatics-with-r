# Introduction

## What we will cover

Our goal is to develop an understanding of how to do applied geospatial analysis in R. We'll also touch on a few features of R as a language along the way. 

## Workflow

Using the diagram below as a guide,

(from Gromelund/Wickham 2016)

we’re going to work through a few problems in service of these analytical projects and learning goals:


|chapter | analytical goal                                      | learning goal            |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
|4| Describe GIS questions on StackExchange              | Intro to R/tidyverse            |
|5| Estimate the portion of the Earth that is "Urban"    | Intro to simple features         |
|6| Describe the demographics of NYC Subway Lines        | Spatial Joins/Interactives       |

## Visualization

>“The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst’s mind than any other >device.” — John Tukey (as quoted in Gromelund/Wickham-2016) 

### Mapview

The [mapview](https://github.com/r-spatial/mapview) package is the best place to start for a new user.   

Throughout this workshop we're going to use it to explore out work. 

Its incredibly easy to use. It takes 1 argument, which is a simple features dataframe.

```{r}
library(mapview)
mapview(breweries)
```

R has a number of great packages for interacting with geographic data visually. These packages can change quickly, so the reader is urged to investigate whats available. Another great example is the [tmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/index.html) package.  

## GeoJSON in R

We're going to leverage small, in-memory datasets. 

The motivation for this is:

>This is the right place 
>to start because you can’t tackle big data unless 
>you have experience with small data...[to] easily handle 
>hundreds of megabytes of data, and with a little care 
>you can typically use them to work with 1-2 Gb of data. 
>If you’re routinely working with larger data (10-100 Gb, say)
>you should learn more about data.table.. (Gromelund/Wickham-2016) 

A lot of geospatial data are difficult to deal with well in-memory. 

R is great for getting a handle on geospatial problems that can later be scaled up in a spatial database, for example. 

## Tidy Data / Spatial Data

If you come from a geospatial background, 'tidy' data is something you're familiar with. 

The following diagram (Gromelund, Wickham - 2016), identifies how "observations" should fall along rows.

One simple way of thinking about cartography is as the plotting of observations about geographic features. So each row has an observation about a feature: the height of a tree, the people of a certain age in a census tract. 

Speaking precisely, while many observations that we make about the the world happen at or within approximate cartographic features, none of them actually are exactly those features in the world. 

For example, many Census observations are estimates about a group of people within a geographic feature. But groups of people aren't exact features on the earth. At best our estimates are approximations. 

'Tidy' gives us a vocabulary for communicating about how we move between observations of implicitly geographic features of the world and explicit plots on a map.
