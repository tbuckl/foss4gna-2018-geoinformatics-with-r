# Transit & Census

This section is focus on how the concept of `tidy` data that we started with can be extended into working with data standards that contain geospatial information but don't consider that information primary. 

We're going to do so using a modified version of the "Take the A Train" example from the Paul Ramsey's excellent PostGIS training (FOSS4G Denver 2011).

## Analysis Goal

Our goal will be to summarize the self-reported racial and ethnic profile of the New York City Subways. 

## Learning Goal

Joining geospatial data and making an interactive web map.  

## Requirements

You'll need to install a few packages if you don't have them already. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidycensus")
```

Load some useful packages. 

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidycensus)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
```

## Census

Now lets load census data for NYC from tidycensus. 

NYC county fips codes:

```
005 - Bronx
047 - Kings (Brooklyn)
061 - New York (Manhattan)
081 - Queens
085 - Richmond (Staten Island)
```

First we'll need to request and add our census API key. You can request a key [here](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html). 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
census_api_key("YOUR API KEY")
```

Now we can pull the demographic data of interest for NYC. 

note: we wrap the API call 'get_acs' in invisible to suppress the download bar in the output here. you don't need to do that. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
nyc_counties <- c('005','047','061','081','085')
race_vars = c("B03002_003", "B03002_004", "B03002_006", "B03002_012")

race_table_nyc <- invisible(
                            get_acs(geography = "tract", 
                                variables = race_vars,
                                state = "NY", 
                                county=nyc_counties,
                                year=2016,
                                summary_var="B03002_001",
                                survey = "acs5", 
                                geometry=TRUE)
)
```

## Transit

### Finding Transit Data

There are a number of excellent sites for finding transit data online, including [transitfeeds](https://transitfeeds.com) and [transit.land's Feed Registry](https://transit.land/feed-registry/operators/o-dr5r-nyct). 

Transit.land includes GeoJSON URL's for routes that we can import directly with sf. For example: 

```{r, include=FALSE}
routes <- st_read("https://transit.land/api/v1/routes.geojson?operated_by=o-dr5r-nyct&per_page=false")
```

Lets have a look at what data are included. 

We can use R's plot function to plot the routes, careful to set max.plot=1, otherwise a plot is rendered for every column in the data frame.  

```{r}
plot(routes, max.plot=1)
```

Looks like this is all of the transit types in NYC. 

```{r}
unique(routes$vehicle_type)
```

Lets filter the transit data down to metro lines and plot them again. 

We'll also rename the 'name' field for the route to route_id so its clear what it means when we join it to demographic data. 

```{r}
metro_routes <- routes %>% filter(vehicle_type=="metro") %>% 
  rename(route_id=name)

plot(metro_routes, max.plot=1)
```

OK these look fine. So what are the demographics of neighbording census tracts of NYC trains?

We first need to set the Census and gtfs data to the same Coordinate Reference System (CRS).  

```{r}
metro_routes <- st_transform(metro_routes, crs=2263)
race_table_nyc <- st_transform(race_table_nyc, crs=2263)
```

## dplyr

Now we are close to the goal: summarizing and mapping the racial and ethnic identity profile of NYC Subway line neighborhoods.  

Lets join the routes and race tables spatially. 

```{r}
route_demographics <- st_join(metro_routes, race_table_nyc)
```

Now that we have the route id's on the demographic table, I'm going to do some summary work on the data. This will be faster if I drop the geometries off the able for now. 

```{r}
st_geometry(route_demographics)<-(NULL)
```

```{r}
df1 <- route_demographics %>%
      select(route_id,variable,estimate,summary_est)
```

Now lets figure out what the demographic profile of the populations around each train is. 

```{r}
route_demographics <- route_demographics %>%
  select(route_id,variable,estimate, summary_est) %>%
  group_by(route_id,variable) %>%
  summarize(estimate_sum=sum(estimate),
            percent_of_total=round(sum(estimate)/sum(summary_est),2),
            total=sum(summary_est))
```

Lets give the variables better names

```{r}
shortnames <- c('White', 'Black', 'Asian', 'Hispanic')
better_names_df <- tibble(variable = race_vars, group_identity=shortnames)
```

Now lets join that tibble back to our dataframe to fill out the better names in our summary data frame. 

```{r}
route_demographics <- left_join(route_demographics,better_names_df) %>%
                  select(route_id,group_identity,percent_of_total)
head(route_demographics)
```

## Tidy Maps

And finally, lets put the table on a map. 

This simple action teaches us an important lesson about 2 things:

1) tidy data--each observation is a row in the dataframe
2) maps--each observation is a geographic unit

![Tidy Data](images/tidy-1.png)

(Gromelund/Wickham-2016)

So we need to spread the census observations out to geographic units. In this case, to subway lines. We'll use the tidyr::spread function to do this. 

```{r}
route_demographics <- route_demographics %>% spread(group_identity, percent_of_total)
head(route_demographics)
```

Now lets join it back to the spatial data and put it on a map. 

```{r}
route_demographics_sf <- left_join(metro_routes,route_demographics)
mapview(route_demographics_sf, zcol="Hispanic", legend=TRUE, map.types="Stamen.TonerLite")
```
